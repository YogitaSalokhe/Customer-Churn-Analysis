üí° Predicting churn opens the door to exciting possibilities, enabling tailored marketing campaigns that precisely target at-risk customers.

# Problem Statement:
Design bank customer churn analysis dashboard which provides valuable insights into customer retention and churn rates, enabling the bank to make data-driven decisions to reduce customer attrition and improve overall customer satisfaction. 

# key insights that can be gained from a dashboard:
1. Churn Rate Trends: The dashboard will display the churn rate over time, helping identify periods with high or low churn rates. This allows the bank to correlate churn with specific events, marketing campaigns, or changes in services, facilitating targeted interventions.
2. Customer Segmentation: By categorizing customers based on demographics, behavior, or account types, the dashboard can reveal which customer segments are more likely to churn. This information helps focus retention efforts on the most vulnerable groups.
3. Churn Reasons: Analyzing the reasons behind customer churn is crucial. The dashboard may display common churn reasons such as high fees, poor customer service, or limited product offerings. Addressing these issues can help prevent further churn.
4. Comparative Analysis: The dashboard might include comparisons of churn rates and retention efforts across branches, regions, or products. This aids in identifying best practices and areas where improvement is needed.
